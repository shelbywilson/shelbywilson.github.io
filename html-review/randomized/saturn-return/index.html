i thought i knew what i needed to figure it all out<br><br>

i thought i had it all figured out <br><br>

i thought once i had it all i'd be happy<br><br>

i thought i'd be happy once i figured it out<br><br>

i thought i'd be<br><br>

i thought i<br><br>

i thought i'd be happy<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

this is how i'd always thought of life<br><br>

something unmanageable<br><br>

meant to be won<br><br>

something to be taken from before it takes from you<br><br>

melancholy my only inheritance<br><br>

a moment of joy meant<br><br>

waiting for the other shoe to drop<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">

*<br><br></span>
        
i am thinking of you<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

for weeks<br><br>

i walked through brooklyn with my hand over my heart<br><br>

waiting for you to tell me you no longer love me <br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

but that's not what happened<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">

at the start of the year<br><br>

rachel read my cards<br><br>

i don't remember what the spread was called&mdash;<br><br>

something like the wheel of the year? <br><br>

something like that<br><br>

each part of the year was represented by a quadrant<br><br>

i pulled the hanged man<br><br>

the star<br><br>

the lovers<br><br>

but the other cards said that my life would change<br><br>

and that i would have to change with it<br><br><br>


i didn't want to believe that<br><br>

so i made up something else <br><br>

some other interpretation<br><br>

that didn't end the way it ended<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

i'm not good with change<br><br>
 
i don't like surprises<br><br>

everything good in my life i've wanted to pin fast like a butterfly<br><br>

a beautiful day becomes a memory even as i experience it,<br><br>

the colors and the sounds like a sheet of paper floating in developer<br><br>

and i <br><br>

lower it into the water<br><br><br><br>



ascribe a meaning to it <br><br>

before it knows what it means<br><br>

i'm like the man on the speedboat in the wendell berry poem&mdash;<br><br>

my eye the camera, already choosing my own recollection<br><br>

the words i'll use to tell the story i'll tell<br><br>

this used to be a kind of power<br><br>

making the narrative<br><br><br><br>



i was so used to telling the story<br><br>

to writing the truth i felt i deserved<br><br>

when nothing else seemed to write it<br><br><br><br>



but i<br><br>

ignored the river<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

there's a part in a mary gaitskill novel <br><br>

veronica<br><br>

where the narrator comes home<br><br>

sad, after a party i think&mdash;<br><br>

i'll just quote it&mdash;<br><br>

let me find it&mdash;<br><br>

“It was 4:00 in the morning, <br><br>

but when she saw how unhappy I was, <br><br>

she took out her tarot cards and told my fortune <br><br>

until it came out the way I wanted it.”<br><br>

it was kind of like that<br><br>

no<br><br>

that was exactly how it went<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

if i have a flaw it is fatal<br><br>

if my flaw is fatal it is this<br><br>

i didn't allow you to love me<br><br>

the way you were trying<br><br>

<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

it was august and everyone seemed to be going through it<br><br>

clare told me it was called a saturn return<br><br>

she read some parts out loud from an email<br><br>

an astrologer client of hers had sent her<br><br>

<em>in your saturn return<br><br>

everything you know about yourself will be wiped away </em><br><br>

&mdash;i am loosely paraphrasing&mdash;<br><br>

<em>everything will be worn away, everything stripped<br><br>

everything ground down <br><br>

everything bare<br><br>

and when you find the bloody nub that's left<br><br>

that's when you'll realize<br><br>

that bloody nub <br><br>

that's who you are</em><br><br><br>


naturally this frightened me <br><br>

i didn't want to accept it<br><br>

i've accumulated so much in my life, so many selves<br><br>

so many things tacked up in my room<br><br>

an armature of a life<br><br>

a life i had worked to build<br><br>

it had been a long time since i had to consider who i am<br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

in the two weeks before we broke up for real<br><br>

i found myself drawn to new age instagram accounts<br><br>

there was some solace in it<br><br>

like if i chose the right card<br><br>

the thing we'd begun to do would be undone<br><br>

and my life would remain the same<br><br><br>


but that was the problem<br><br>

it couldn't stay the same<br><br><br>


every spring a plant needs to be repotted<br><br>

cuttings need to take root in new soil <br><br>

even the vines of wisteria that twine around the stone columns<br><br>

at the entrance to the park <br><br>

don't stop growing<br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

the day after we ended things<br><br>

i woke up with a roaring in my head<br><br>

the roaring was empty and loud<br><br>

and i <br><br>

was shipwrecked<br><br>

this is it, is this it,<br><br>

is this it, this is it, <br><br>

this is it, <br><br>

this is, <br><br>

is it this, <br><br>

it must be <br><br>

this<br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>

*<br>
*<br><br></span>

saturn has returned to where it was when i was born <br><br>

and i have returned to spring<br><br>

the magnolia buds are slate gray <br><br>

and furring on the trees<br><br>

i can tell you about it,<br><br>

the greening, the small<br><br>

slick leaves unfurling, <br><br>

how in just a few weeks<br><br>

the petals of the stone fruit trees<br><br>

will scatter on the sidewalk like snow,<br><br>

i can tell you about it, <br><br>

the drawn-out days, <br><br>

how long and orange a sunset becomes<br><br>

when i watch it from my room<br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

i can tell you <br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>

*<br><br></span>

i've been learning so much<br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br>
*<br><br></span>

i can tell you <br><br>


<span class="asterisks">
*<br><br></span>

what i know is<br><br>
