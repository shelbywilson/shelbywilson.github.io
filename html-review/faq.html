                        Does the work have to primarily use html?
                    </summary>
                    <dl>
                        No. That’s just a name. We are interested in any sort of digital, code, or software based literary work, regardless of language, though obviously accessibility over the web is probably a plus.

                        Does the work have to be interactive?
                    </summary>
                    <dl>
                        No! Static poetry and writing is totally fair game. If it feels to you like it makes the most sense on the web, then we would love to take a look :)

                        Do creators own their own work?
                    </summary>
                    <dl>
                        Yes. All contributors own everything in perpetuity and are free to iterate and publish it elsewhere. <em>the html review</em> wants to be more of an incubator and cheerleader than a traditional publisher. Anything contributors make belongs to them and them alone.

                        Does <em>the html review</em> have to host the work?
                    </summary>
                    <dl>
                        One of the beautiful things about the web is that links make centralization unnecessary. While we would love a copy of the code for archival purposes, you are totally free to host your submission somewhere else if that makes the most sense!

                        No. <em>the html review</em> is funded out of pocket purely as a fun hobby project

                    <dl>
                        No, not right now. Maybe not ever? We prefer to drive all engagement toward our contributors.
